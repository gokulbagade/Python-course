CHAPTER 7 - LOOPS IN PYTHON
Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program. For instance: Print 1 to 1000.

Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer which set of instructions to repeat and how!

TYPES OF LOOPS IN PYTHON
Primarily there are two types of loops in python.

· while loops

· for loops

We will look into these one by one.

**WHILE LOOP** <br>
Syntax:

while (condition): # The block keeps executing until the condition is true

**Body of the loop**
In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop is executed otherwise not!

If the loop is entered, the process of [condition check & execution] is continued until the condition becomes False.

Quick Quiz: Write a program to print 1 to 50 using a while loop.

Example:

i = 0 while i < 5: # print "Harry" - 5 times! print("Harry") i = i + 1

Note: If the condition never become false, the loop keeps getting executed.


FOR LOOP

A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like list, tuple, or string [iterables]

Syntax:

1 = [1, 7, 8] for item in 1: print(item) # prints 1, 7 and 8 ☐

RANGE FUNCTION IN PYTHON

The range() function in python is used to generate a sequence of number.

We can also specify the start, stop and step-size as follows:

range(start, stop, step_size) # step_size is usually not used with range()

AN EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATING RANGE () FUNCTION.

for i in range(0,7): # range(7) can also be used. print(i) # prints 0 to 6 FOR LOOP WITH ELSE

An optional else can be used with a for loop if the code is to be executed when the loops exhausts.

THE BREAK STATEMENT :-

'break' is used to come out of the loop when encountered. It instructs the program to - exit the loop now.

Example:

for i in range (0,80):
 print(i) # this will print 0,1,2 and 3 if i == 3 break

THE CONTINUE STATEMENT
'continue' is used to stop the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next one. It instructs the Program to "skip this iteration".

Example:

for i in range(4):
 print("printing") 
 if i == 2:      # if i is 2, the iteration is skipped continue print(i)

 PASS STATEMENT.

I pass îs a null statement in python.

It instructs to "do nothing".

Example:

1 = [1,7,8] for item in 1: pass # without pass, the program will throw an error
